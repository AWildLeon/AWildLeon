# Hey, I'm Leon 👋

Sysadmin • Network Operator • Hobby-Dev

Running my own infrastructure because curiosity scales better than excuses.

I work mostly with Linux (NixOS by choice, not accident), build and operate networks (yes, including BGP and my own ASN), and enjoy automating systems until they behave.

I spend my time somewhere between:

* operating ISP-ish infrastructure at home
* breaking things to understand them
* fixing them properly afterwards

From small scripts to unnecessarily serious setups — if it’s technical and slightly overkill, I’m probably interested.
